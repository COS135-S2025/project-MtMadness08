///////////////////////// Description /////////////////////////


This program is a guessing game based on Pokemon.

It takes in 3 files that each have a list of 21 different Pokemon
and their hints. It steps through each one, and each time a new
question is asked, it gets moved to the bottom of the file. This
way you never get a repeat question when you're done playing.

//////////////////////// How to play ////////////////////////////

When you start the file, you will be asked to select a difficulty

Every input needs to be capital.
It has to be capital otherwise it sees it as invalid.

Type either "Easy", "Normal", or "Hard" into the command line.

This will take you to whatever difficulty you selected. Visually
there is no change aside from it telling you what difficulty.

You will be given the National Pokedex number of the pokemon.
You can either type "Hint" for a hint, or guess the name of the
pokemon. These inputs also have to be capital.

The player gets 5 guesses and hints. When you are out of hints
the game will inform you. Once you run out of hints, the game
ends and tells you the answer.

When the game ends, it will ask if you want to play again, you
may input "y" or "n" to select. These are not capital inputs.

If "y" was input, the game will restart from the difficulty select.
If "n" was input, the game will close.
